    "The Darcy equation is a fundamental principle in fluid dynamics, particularly in the study of porous media. It describes the flow of a fluid through a porous medium and is analogous to the diffusion equation in many ways.\n",

    "$$ \\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla P $$\n",

    "- \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) is the volumetric flux (flow rate per unit area).\n",

    "The analogy between Darcy's Law and Fick's Law lies in the similarity of their forms.

    "5. **Environmental Engineering**: Used in the study of contaminant transport through soil and groundwater.\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D_u \\nabla^2 u + u(1 - u) - v $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = D_v \\nabla^2 v + u - v $$\n",
